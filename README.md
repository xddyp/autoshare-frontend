# AutoShare

AutoShare is a driverless car-sharing app for car owners to rent out vehicles and renters to search and book available vehicles. The app is inspired and based on the idea of how self-driving car technology will change the way people share and rent cars.

This is a repository for the frontend code.

# Demo

Here is a working live demo: https://autoshare-demo.firebaseapp.com/

# Features

- For car owners:
  - Once the car owner granted the app access to his car account, the app will automatically get information of car model, location, battery level, and so on.
  - Host can list their car by setting available time and price
- For car renters:
  - As a self-drive car can pick up the renter from anywhere, the listing searching results are ordered by the time taken to arrive.
  - Once finished the trip, renters only need to confirm the return for a car to return to the original location or be rented out again by the ownerâ€™s selection.
